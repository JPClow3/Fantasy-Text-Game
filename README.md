### _A Chronicle Woven from Light, Choice, and the Fading Song_

**Hark, Seeker of Echoes!** You stand at the precipice of **Resonant Echoes**, a living chronicle whispered into existence upon the digital loom. Within this realm, your every choice shall sculpt the unfolding narrative, forge bonds, and determine the fate of Aerthos, a world teetering on the precipice as the divine Aethel Song fades into the encroaching silence of the Unraveling.

You are a **Confluence Point**, a soul uniquely attuned to the **Weave** of reality, gifted with the rare ability to perceive and interact with **Echoes** ‚Äì the lingering psychic imprints of past events, potent emotions, and the very energies that bind creation. These are the threads of history, and you, Resonator, are the weaver.

Forged in the luminous heart of Google's Gemini and visualized through the arcane lens of Imagen, Resonant Echoes offers a deeply personal and ever-evolving pilgrimage into a world where the past is not merely remembered, but palpably felt.

## üìú Whispers of Aerthos (The World)

The very fabric of Aerthos is woven from **Echoes**. These are not mere specters of memory, but tangible vestiges of what has transpired ‚Äì a whispered vow, the crescendo of a forgotten battle, the dying luminescence of a celestial body, or the indomitable will of a civilization lost to time. The **Silent Architects**, beings of immense power and mystery, once sculpted this reality, their cyclopean structures now slumbering ruins, thrumming with primordial energies.

Yet, a shadow lengthens. The **Aethel Song**, the cosmic symphony that underpins all existence, wanes. In its stead, the **Unraveling Song** rises ‚Äì a cacophony of **Dissonance** that corrupts the pure Echoes, distorts the Weave of reality, and threatens to engulf all in an abyss of nothingness.

You, Resonator, are a **Confluence Point**, an individual whose spirit resonates with a clarity rarely seen, granting you this profound connection to the Echoes. Your path will lead you through lands saturated with ancient magic and tainted by the creeping blight, where disparate factions vie for dwindling power and forgotten truths lie dormant, awaiting a keen mind and a courageous heart to bring them to light. Will you be the one to mend the fracturing Weave, or will your passage merely hasten its descent into oblivion?

## üõ†Ô∏è The Arcane Engineering (Technology Behind the Veil)

The manifestation of Resonant Echoes upon your scrying device is achieved through a confluence of sophisticated enchantments from the world beyond Aerthos:

*   **The Oracle's Mind (AI Narrative & Logic)**: The tale is dynamically woven by the **Google Gemini API** (specifically, the `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17` incantation). Its responses are shaped by the sacred `CORE_SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION` and a grimoire of prompt templates located within the `constants.ts` scroll.
*   **The Seer's Eye (AI Image Generation)**: Visions of Aerthos are conjured by the **Google Imagen API** (the `imagen-3.0-generate-002` rune), breathing visual life into key moments and vistas.
*   **The Soul of the Interface (Frontend)**: Crafted with [React](https://reactjs.org/) (a framework of potent constructs) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) (a language of precise runes) for a resilient and captivating experience.
*   **Aesthetic Glyphs (Styling)**: The visual harmony is maintained by [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) (channeled via CDN) and custom stylistic edicts inscribed within the `index.html` foundation.
*   **The Keeper of Memories (State Management)**: The ever-shifting tapestry of the game's state is meticulously managed by React's `useReducer` enchantment.
*   **Conduits of Knowledge (ES Modules & Import Maps)**: Ancient scriptures and modern incantations (React, Google GenAI SDK) are summoned directly by the browser using import maps defined in the `index.html` scroll.

## üöÄ Attuning Your Orb (Getting Started)

Prepare your own resonance to commune with the world of Aerthos. Follow these sacred rites:

### Incantations of Preparation (Prerequisites)

*   **A Wellspring of Power (Node.js)**: Ensure this font of digital energy flows within your local system. You may draw it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) (Version 18.x or higher is auspicious).
*   **The Weaver's Tools (npm or yarn)**: These implements of creation often accompany the Wellspring.
*   **A Modern Scrying Glass (Web Browser)**: One that understands the modern runes of ES Modules and Import Maps (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari of recent vintages).

### Rites of Installation & Configuration

1.  **Acquire the Codex** (Clone the Repository, if this scroll is part of a larger library):
    ```bash
    git clone https://your-repository-url/resonant-echoes.git # Replace with the true astral path
    cd resonant-echoes
    ```
    If this `README.md` is a standalone artifact, ensure all accompanying scrolls (`index.html`, `index.tsx`, `App.tsx`, `types.ts`, `constants.ts`, `metadata.json`, and the `components` sanctum) are gathered in one consecrated project space.

2.  **Bind the Lesser Spirits** (Install Dependencies, if applicable):
    While the primary spirits of React and `@google/genai` are summoned via import maps, should your local sanctum employ other familiars for development (linters, dev servers), bind them with:
    Using npm:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    Or using yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **The Keystone of Power (Environment Variables - The Gemini API Key)**:
    To allow the Oracle of Gemini to speak through this application, a pact must be made in the form of an API Key.
    *   **The Vital Connection**: The application, in its `App.tsx` heartwood, seeks this Key via `process.env.API_KEY`.
    *   **For Local Communion (Without a Grand Conjunction/Build Step)**: You must manually inscribe your API Key.
        *   Unseal the `App.tsx` scroll.
        *   Locate the lines:
            `const ai = new GoogleGenAI({ apiKey: process.env.API_KEY || "MISSING_KEY_FOR_AI_INIT" });`
            And in `initialGameState`: `apiKeyMissing: !process.env.API_KEY,`
        *   Replace `process.env.API_KEY` with your personal sigil (API Key string):
            ```typescript
            // An example inscription:
            const yourPersonalSigil = "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE";
            const ai = new GoogleGenAI({ apiKey: yourPersonalSigil || "MISSING_KEY_FOR_AI_INIT" });
            // ...and for the initial state:
            // apiKeyMissing: !yourPersonalSigil,
            ```
    *   **A Word of Caution**: If you manually inscribe your Key, **shield this alteration from the public gaze** if you share your works through the Great Archives (version control).
    *   You may beseech Google AI Studio for such a Key: [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

4.  **Awaken the Chronicle (Run the Application)**:
    The `index.html` scroll directly summons `index.tsx`. This implies a subtle enchantment (a build tool or a transpilation ritual) is expected if you have complex TypeScript/JSX. For simpler communion:
    *   **Via a Humble Hearth (Simple HTTP Server)**:
        From your project's sacred circle (root directory), invoke:
        ```bash
        npx http-server .
        ```
        This typically opens a portal at `http://localhost:8080`. Gaze into your Scrying Glass at this location.
    *   **Via an Alchemist's Circle (If a `package.json` with start scripts exists)**:
        ```bash
        npm start
        # or
        yarn start
        ```
        This often automates the awakening, opening the portal in your Scrying Glass.

üéâ The Weave stirs! You are now attuned to the Resonant Echoes.

## üéÆ The Weaver's Art (Key Game Mechanics)

Familiarize yourself with the core arts that will shape your journey through Aerthos:

*   **The Genesis of Self (Character Creation)**:
    *   Your odyssey commences as you define your **Archetype** (e.g., The Attuned Scholar, The Sylvan Empath), your **Origin** (e.g., The Aethelgardian Sky-Court Archives, The Heartwood Grove), and your **Background** (e.g., Novice Lexicographer of Echoes, Listener to Sap-Song).
    *   Each affirmation grants singular boons, influences your nascent **Player Echoic Signature**, and may bestow ancestral lore or potent artifacts. This sacred rite is guided by structured incantations found within the `constants.ts` scroll.

*   **The Symphony of Sensation (Echo Weaving)**:
    *   **Whispering Echoes**: The world resonates with faint psychic imprints. You shall perceive these as textual glimmers ‚Äì hints of bygone eras, surges of emotion, or truths hidden from mundane senses.
    *   **The Art of Synthesis**: Unite disparate Whispering Echoes or fragments of lore to distill profound insights or reconstruct complete historical accounts.
    *   **Harmonic Attunement**: Focus your inner resonance upon artifacts to awaken their dormant Echoes, thereby unveiling their veiled histories or latent powers.
    *   **The Price of Power**: Weaving is not without its toll. Intense exertions may result in a dulling of the senses, throbbing headaches, or even fray the sanity of your Player Echoic Signature, manifesting as `PlayerTemporaryCondition`.

*   **The Shadow of Dissonance**:
    *   The Unraveling Song manifests as Dissonance, a force of corruption twisting the Weave.
    *   Confront **Echoic Blights** (festering wounds upon reality), **Memory Phantoms** (distorted, agonizing Echoes of once-living beings), and **Devouring Silence Zones** (voids where all Echoes are nullified, and resonance falters).
    *   Dissonance will challenge your abilities and present unique perils, as chronicled in the `DissonanceEffect` scriptures.

*   **The Echoic Signature (Your "Symphony of Self")**:
    *   This is a living, narrative representation of your character's resonant core ‚Äì the unique song your spirit sings.
    *   It evolves and transforms based on your most significant choices, your mastery (or corruption) through Echo Weaving, and your harrowing encounters with Dissonance, mirroring your odyssey and your indelible impact upon the world.

*   **The Keeper's Trove (Lore Journal & Fragments)**:
    *   Unearth complete **Lore Entries** that illuminate the rich history, diverse cultures, and arcane mysteries of Aerthos.
    *   Gather **Lore Fragments** ‚Äì scattered shards of forgotten knowledge that, when skillfully combined, can reveal comprehensive truths.
    *   Maintain your **Personal Journal**, a sacred space for your own reflections, theories, and reminders.

*   **The Surge of Resonance**:
    *   A formidable, yet finite, ability allowing you to channel a potent burst of your inner resonant power.
    *   Its effects are manifold: clarifying obfuscated Echoes, temporarily mitigating the effects of Dissonance, bestowing crucial epiphanies, or awakening latent properties within enchanted items. Wield this power with sagacity, for it requires time to replenish.

*   **The Sharpened Senses (Focus Senses)**:
    *   Actively extend your perception beyond the mundane, probing your surroundings for the more subtle, ambient, or ancient Echoes that might elude a cursory glance. This intense focus may, at times, lead to minor mental fatigue.

*   **The Dance of Choice & Consequence (Narrative Progression)**:
    *   The chronicle unfolds through the choices you embrace. The Oracle (AI) consults the `CONTINUE_GAME_PROMPT_TEMPLATE` and the current `GameContextForAI` to weave subsequent scenes and present new diverging paths.
